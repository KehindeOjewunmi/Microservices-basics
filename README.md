# Microservices-basics

What are Monolitic Applications?

Monolitic Applications are heavy duty applications with an architecture that has the user interface, business logic, file systems and database tighly packed as a single unit.

This kind of architecture has lots of drawback. Some of the drawbacks are:
  - language dependent
  - scaling difficulty
  - bug fix and update difficulty

To address these drawbacks, an architectural approach that has loosely coupled business logics, file systems and databases interacting with user interface was developed and called microservices. Interactions among the services and end users are achieved by the use of application programming interface (API)

Among several benefits of microservices are:
  - language and build tool independent
  - fast iteraton - agility
  - fault isolation
  - segregated functionality
  - segregated scaling
